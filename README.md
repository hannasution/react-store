# react-store

## Backstory

As a growing developer, I realized I haven't been contributing anything to the React community, so I created react-store as my first open-source project. The goal is to create a simple enough store, but robust enough for small to large-scale applications.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create Store class in vanilla.
- [ ] Create a hook for React.
